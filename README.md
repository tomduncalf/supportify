# Supportify

Support the artists you listen to on Spotify by buying their music on Bandcamp

### About

Supportify is a simple app which uses the Spotify API to get your top artists/tracks, then links off to Bandcamp search pages for the track/artist (no Bandcamp API sadly).

It's all done client side and no data is stored anywhere.

Built with create-react-app, Typescript, Material UI and spotify-web-api-js
